# OS

A minimal 32-bit x86 operating system written in C and Assembly. Built from scratch for educational purposes to understand how operating systems work at the lowest level.

# Overview

MyOS is a bare-metal operating system that boots via GRUB and runs on x86 hardware or emulators like QEMU. It features a command-line interface with keyboard input, VGA text output, and a simple shell with extensible commands.

# Features

32-bit protected mode kernel\
GRUB Multiboot compliance\
VGA text mode display (80x25)\
PS/2 keyboard driver with key repeat\
Interactive shell with built-in commands\
Adjustable key repeat delay and rate\
Modular driver architecture\
Automatic Git integration for development\
Building\
Requirements\
GCC (with multilib support for 32-bit)\
NASM assembler\
GNU Make\
GRUB utilities\
QEMU (for testing)\
On Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt install nasm gcc-multilib make grub-pc-bin xorriso qemu-system-x86
Compile

make
This creates a bootable ISO at build/os.iso.

Run in QEMU

make run
Clean Build Files

make clean
Commit and Push

make git
This automatically commits changes and pushes to the testing branch.

# VGA Colors

The system supports 16 VGA colors:

Value Color\
0 Black\
1 Blue\
2 Green\
3 Cyan\
4 Red\
5 Magenta\
6 Brown\
7 Light Grey\
8 Dark Grey\
9 Light Blue\
10 Light green\
11 Light Cyan\
12 Light Red\
13 Light Magenta\
14 Light Brown\
15 White

# How It Works

Boot: GRUB loads the kernel at 1MB memory address\
Entry: Assembly bootloader sets up stack and calls C kernel\
Initialize: VGA driver, keyboard driver, and shell are initialized\
Loop: Main loop waits for keyboard input and processes commands\

# Key Repeat

Hold a key to enable auto-repeat. Adjust timing with:

delay <ms> - Time before repeat starts (default: 300ms)\
rate <ms> - Time between repeats (default: 100ms)\
Lower values = faster repeat. Higher values = slower repeat.
